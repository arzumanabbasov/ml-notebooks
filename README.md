## Detailed

### Bigmart Sales Prediction
   - *Description:* This project focuses on predicting the sales of various products in Bigmart stores. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of regression models to forecast sales accurately.
   - *Notebook:* [Bigmart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb](notebooks/Bigmart%20Sales%20Prediction.ipynb)

### Fraud Detection
   - *Description:* Implementing a fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms. The project involves analyzing transaction data, feature engineering, and training a model to identify potentially fraudulent activities.
   - *Notebook:* [Fraud_Detection.ipynb](link_to_notebook_fraud_detection)

### Stock Price Prediction
   - *Description:* Building a time series forecasting model to predict stock prices. The project includes data analysis, time series preprocessing, and the implementation of models such as ARIMA or LSTM for accurate predictions.
   - *Notebook:* [Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb](link_to_notebook_stock_price)

### House Price Prediction
   - *Description:* Predicting house prices using regression models. The project involves exploring housing data, handling missing values, and training a model to estimate house prices based on various features.
   - *Notebook:* [House_Price_Prediction.ipynb](link_to_notebook_house_price)
